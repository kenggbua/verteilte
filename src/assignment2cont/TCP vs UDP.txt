TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    - connection-oriented protocol
    - a message makes its way across the internet from one computer to another. This is connection based.
    - TCP is suited for applications that require high reliability, and transmission time is relatively less critical.
    - used by another protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TelNet
    - TCP rearranges data packets in the order specified.
    - speed of transfer is slower than UDP
    - heavy-weight: requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent


UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    - connectionless protocol
    - used in message transport or transfer. This is not connection based which means that one program can send a load of packets to another and that would be the end of the relationship.
    - UDP is suitable for applications that need fast, efficient transmission, such as games. UDP's stateless nature is also useful for servers that answer small queries from huge numbers of clients.
    - used by another protocols: DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP
    - UDP is faster because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.
    - UDP is lightweight. There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of IP.
